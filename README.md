# Indonesia Stamp Detection
Recognize the Indonesia Stamp collection using Python + Yolov5 that has been trained over the Indonesia stamp dataset. You can run the project on your google collab [(link)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YARMlkGo-BSV0qPWTBFuGV230eICHSjt?usp=sharing).

# Usage
You can download the .ipynb file and then upload it to Google Collab. Everything just plug and play. You may use your local environment (like Anaconda) if you have sufficient computing resources and fast enough internet.

# Dataset
![Sample Dataset](https://github.com/ardfar/indonesia-stamp-detection/blob/main/sample-dataset.png?raw=true)
Our dataset was taken manually by taking photos of each collection to 9 multiple angles and annotating them using Roboflow. You may see the Roboflow annotation project [here](https://app.roboflow.com/ape/indonesia-stamp-recognition/overview) The dataset is taken at 50MP and 64MP resolution using Vivo X80 and Samsung S22
